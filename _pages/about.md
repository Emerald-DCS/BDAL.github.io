About Cheng Meng
======
I am an Assistant professor in Institue of Statistics and Big Data (ISBD), Renmin University of China. I received my PhD degree in Statistics form Department of Statistics at the University of Georgia in 2020. I worked in the Big Data Analytics Lab, under the supervision of Professor Wenxuan Zhong and Professor Ping Ma. I received BSc degree in Mathmatics form Tsinghua University in 2015.

About BDAL LAB
======
Our lab's research interests lie in developing novel theoretically justifiable and computationally efficient methods for tackling the computation burden brought about by the sheer size of large-scale datasets. Our ongoing research interests are as follows.

- Statistical machine learning
- Subsampling methods in big data
- Large-scale optimal transport problems
- Non/Semi-parametric modeling
- Generative models
- Statistical applications in imaging data, LiDAR data and 3d point cloud data

By leveraging advanced statistical models and computational techniques, we have successfully tackled challenges in fields such as image processing, large-scale transportation optimization, and generative modeling. Our research has direct applications in industries including healthcare, autonomous systems, and environmental monitoring. Looking forward, our lab aims to expand its research into new areas such as artificial intelligence, sustainable data analytics, and quantum computing, continuing to push the boundaries of what's possible with statistical methods in practice.
